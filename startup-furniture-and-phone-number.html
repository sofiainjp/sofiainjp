Here is a guide to where you can buy furniture and appliances, and how to apply for a mobile phone number and internet access.</div><div dir="auto"> </div><div dir="auto">Home appliance purchase locations: yodobashi, big camera, Yamada denki</div><div dir="auto"> </div><div dir="auto">In Taiwan, buyers of home appliances may go to places such as Chan Kun, National Electronics, Tatung Home Appliances, etc. to learn about the new products of various brands. In Japan, you can go to yodobashi, big camera and Yamada denki, where many of the latest appliances are on display with illustrations and descriptions, making it easy to shop even if your Japanese is not good enough. Also, during the peak moving season from March to May, there are complete sets of appliances available for sale at lower prices.</div><div dir="auto">    You can compare the prices of the same products in different shopping malls and consider the rebate points. For example, yodobashi and big camera have rebate points and one point is usually discounted to one dollar, which is a good deal. You can use your points to buy small appliances or other items after you have bought the higher priced appliances first. In addition, points can be used to offset the cost of extended warranties, giving you more peace of mind overall. </div><div dir="auto">    Also, when you buy a number of large appliances at once, you can usually get a discount on the price! If your Japanese is not good enough, you can ask for help from a Chinese speaking staff or use translation software to help you communicate with them. In general, the language itself doesn't affect the quality of the service you receive from the shop. The discounts offered at large stores are not very different and finding a staff member or shop that you feel comfortable interacting with will improve your shopping mood!</div><div dir="auto"> </div><div dir="auto"> </div><div dir="auto">Furniture shopping locations: Idli, MUJI, IKEA, Rakuten Market</div><div dir="auto"> </div><div dir="auto">If you want to buy sofas, TV cabinets, dining tables and chairs, bed frames, etc. in Japan, you can basically do it all at<strong> </strong>Nitori. You just need to have a good idea of the size of the item you need, go to Nitori or MUJI to confirm the item and then place your order directly with the shop staff, but buying furniture is different from buying electricity, as the price is usually the total amount of the purchase and there are no additional discounts. Even so, the quality of the products and service is really good. When they are delivered to your home, they are carried carefully to avoid hitting the doors or walls, and afterwards they will help you to install them and put them in the designated place.When assembling, the flooring is mostly covered with mats to avoid scratching the wood.<br><br></div><div dir="auto">Tip :</div><ol><li dir="auto">When buying a fridge or washing machine, it is important to pay attention to the size and orientation of the door. It is advisable to check the size of your home and whether it is against a wall before purchasing the product.</li><li dir="auto">It is also important that the home has a lift and that the lift is large enough to accommodate the appliances and furniture purchased.</li><li dir="auto">Some items have an additional installation fee. Most appliances and furniture will be delivered and installed for you, but some will not be installed and there will be an additional charge if you need a service person to come and install them. However, this will be clearly explained to you at the time of purchase and there will be no unexplained charges.</li></ol><br><div dir="auto"> </div></div><div>Mobile phone number application: softbank, docomo, au, three major telecom solutions</div><div>Once you have obtained your resident card, you can start doing many things! For example: mobile phone numbers, bank accounts (usually only post office banks can be opened first), home internet, credit cards, other membership cards.</div><div> </div><div>Once in Japan, it is advisable to apply for a Japanese phone number to save on international roaming charges and in many cases you will need a phone number in the future!</div><div>    In Taiwan, most people apply for the full plan, however, the cost of telecommunication in Japan is relatively high, so it is advisable to evaluate your monthly usage to decide on a plan. The three major telecoms in Japan have relatively cheap plans: docomo "ahamo", Softbank "LINEMO" and au "povo 2.0", all of which can be applied for online and are very convenient. I chose to apply for the LINEMO plan!<br><br></div><div>LINEMO uses Softbank backline and the quality is quite stable. There are two tariff plans, "Mini Plan ミニプラン (3GB per month JPY990円)" and "Smaho Plan スマホプラン (20GB per month JPY2,728円)". All plans are included in "LINE Giga Free".<br>This means that you can use LINE for unlimited messaging and internet calls without having your monthly traffic deducted, which is very convenient for people who use LINE a lot and don't have to worry about calling back to Taiwan or anywhere else. (LINE location sharing, LINE Live, LINE Sticker Store, news browsing, etc. are not included in the free internet traffic) </div><div> </div><div>Documents required for application：</div><ol><li>Personal identification documents: resident card and passport. If you enter a name or address different from the one on your confirmation card, you will need to upload supplementary information.</li><li>Payment method (credit card in your name or account in Japan). You can apply with a Taiwanese credit card!</li><li>E-mail address to receive confirmation immediately</li><li>Mobile phones without SIM lock</li></ol><p><a href="https://www.linemo.jp/process/">You can find a detailed explanation of the process on the official website</a>. After the screening process, your application for a Japan Linemo SIM card will be sent directly to your home. A resident card is really important!<br><br>--To be continued</p></div><aside class="post__aside"><div class="post__last-updated u-small">This article was updated on August 5, 2022</div><div class="post__share"></div></aside><footer class="post__footer"><ul class="post__tag box"><li><a href="https://sofiainjp.com/tags/ri-ben-chuang-ye/" class="u-tag u-tag--1" title="Startup in Japan">Startup in Japan</a></li></ul><div class="post__bio box"><div><h4 class="h6"><a href="https://sofiainjp.com/authors/sofia/" title="Sofia">Sofia</a></h4></div></div><nav class="post__nav box"><div class="post__nav__prev"><a href="https://sofiainjp.com/rent-an-apartment.html" class="post__nav__link" rel="prev"><img src="https://sofiainjp.com/media/posts/25/responsive/4-xs.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="" height="1236" width="1920"><div class="u-small">Previous Post<h5>Startup  in Japan-Rent an apartment</h5></div></a></div></nav><div class="post__related box"><h3 class="box__title">Related posts</h3><div class="post__related-wrap"><figure class="post__related-item"><a href="https://sofiainjp.com/rent-an-apartment.html" class="c-card__image"><img src="https://sofiainjp.com/media/posts/25/responsive/4-xs.jpg" loading="lazy" height="1236" width="1920" alt=""></a><figcaption><h4 class="post__related-title"><a href="https://sofiainjp.com/rent-an-apartment.html" class="inverse">Startup  in Japan-Rent an apartment</a></h4><time datetime="2022-08-05T08:17" class="u-small">August 5, 2022</time></figcaption></figure><figure class="post__related-item"><a href="https://sofiainjp.com/start-up-visa.html" class="c-card__image"><img src="https://sofiainjp.com/media/posts/24/responsive/3-xs.jpg" loading="lazy" height="1536" width="1920" alt=""></a><figcaption><h4 class="post__related-title"><a href="https://sofiainjp.com/start-up-visa.html" class="inverse">Startup  in Japan-Start Up Visa</a></h4><time datetime="2022-08-05T08:16" class="u-small">August 5, 2022</time></figcaption></figure><figure class="post__related-item"><a href="https://sofiainjp.com/company-establishment.html" class="c-card__image"><img src="https://sofiainjp.com/media/posts/23/responsive/1-xs.jpg" loading="lazy" height="640" width="960" alt=""></a><figcaption><h4 class="post__related-title"><a href="https://sofiainjp.com/company-establishment.html" class="inverse">Startup  in Japan-Company establishment</a></h4><time datetime="2022-08-05T08:15" class="u-small">August 5, 2022</time></figcaption></figure></div></div></footer></article></main><div class="sidebar"><section class="box u-ads"><h3 class="u-ads__title">Advertisement</h3><script async src="https://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js?client=ca-pub-8322803034511439" crossorigin="anonymous"></script></section><section class="box authors"><h3 class="box__title">Authors</h3><ul class="authors__cotainer"><li class="authors__item"><div><a href="https://sofiainjp.com/authors/sofia/" class="authors__title">Sofia</a> <span class="u-small">Post: 26</span></div></li></ul></section><section class="box"><h3 class="box__title">Tags</h3><ul class="tags"><li><a href="https://sofiainjp.com/tags/chugoku-region-zhong-guo-di-fang/">Chugoku Region (中国地方)</a> <span class="u-small">(3)</span></li><li><a href="https://sofiainjp.com/tags/kansai-guan-xi/">Kansai (関西)</a> <span class="u-small">(7)</span></li><li><a href="https://sofiainjp.com/tags/kanto-guan-dong/">Kanto (関東)</a> <span class="u-small">(4)</span></li><li><a href="https://sofiainjp.com/tags/kyushu-jiu-zhou/">Kyushu (九州)</a> <span class="u-small">(2)</span></li><li><a href="https://sofiainjp.com/tags/ri-ben-chuang-ye/">Startup in Japan</a> <span class="u-small">(10)</span></li></ul></section></div><footer class="footer"><a class="footer__logo" href="https://sofiainjp.com/"><img src="https://sofiainjp.com/media/website/Mylogo5-150_150.png" alt="sofiainjp"></a><nav><ul class="footer__nav"></ul></nav><div class="footer__follow"><a href="https://twitter.com/Sofia43927906" aria-label="Twitter"><svg><use xlink:href="https://sofiainjp.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#twitter"/></svg> </a><a href="https://www.instagram.com/sofiainjp/" aria-label="Instagram"><svg><use xlink:href="https://sofiainjp.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#instagram"/></svg> </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGWwtdz7W1PJj_QgSpy6VZA/featured" aria-label="Youtube"><svg><use xlink:href="https://sofiainjp.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#youtube"/></svg></a></div><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Powered by Sofiainjp</p></div></footer></div><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig = {
