These deer are very cute and friendly, probably because tourists feed them with "Deer <i>Senbei</i> ".</p><p>The "Deer <i>Senbei</i> " are pancakes made of rice bran and flour that visitors can buy to feed the deer. The Nara Park Deer Lovers Association makes this kind of feed for visitors to buy, and the proceeds are used as a fund for the association's operation.</p><p>For the purpose of health conservation, the "Deer <i>Senbei</i> " are not seasoned, so they must not have much flavor, but the original fragrance of the rice bran must be very strong.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://i.imgur.com/3s4JHCx.jpg" data-is-external-image="true"></p><p>There are more than 1,000 deer in Nara Park, and the largest number of deer are females! Except for the doe that will be moved to another area in case of a car accident or impending birth, these free little guys in Nara Park are all wild! However, because these deer are wild and may attack people, it is still necessary to pay attention to safety.</p><figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://i.imgur.com/YtO5aAD.jpg" data-is-external-image="true" alt="" width="800" height="1000"></figure><p>"<a href="http://www.todaiji.or.jp/english/index.html">Todai-ji Temple</a>, known for its ""Daibutsu-san,"" or Great Buddha, is a representative temple in Nara, with an imposing appearance of the largest wooden structure in the world. This is a famous temple of the Kegon sect and was founded by Roben.</p><figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://i.imgur.com/SrUEsgp.jpg" data-is-external-image="true" alt="" width="1000" height="563"></figure><p>Todai-ji Temple has a history of 1200 years. During the Nara period, when there were coups and rebellions, Emperor Somu wanted to use the power of Buddhism to relieve social unrest and ordered the construction of Kokubunji and Kokubuniji temples in various countries.</p><p>The south gate of Todai-ji Temple (Daikanyinji Gate) is a very imposing wooden structure.You need to buy a ticket to enter Todai-ji Temple, and once you enter, you will see the magnificent Great Buddha Hall, which was registered as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1998.</p><p>Todai-ji Temple is the largest wooden building in the world (47.5 meters high), built as a result of cultural exchange between the Tang Dynasty and China.</p><figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://i.imgur.com/boYlVbe.jpg" data-is-external-image="true" alt="" width="1000" height="563"></figure><p>Nara City, the oldest capital of Japan and the city with the most domestic world heritage in Japan. It takes an incredible amount of speed to walk the entire World Heritage Site in one day.
