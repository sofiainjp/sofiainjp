It is not easy to find a suitable room in Japan. It is advisable to rent a suite for a month when you first arrive in Japan because you will need to apply for a resident card at the ward office two weeks after entering Japan (Remember! After you have processed your resident card, your health insurance card and pension payment will be sent to this address. If you change your address, remember to go to the ward office and post office as soon as possible to correct your address). So, in addition to having an address to log into your resident card, you can also find your ideal place to live during this time! Of course, if you don't mind sharing a bathroom, a share house is also an option. Many share houses are willing to allow renters to register their resident card. By the way! Hotel and Airbnb addresses cannot be used as a resident card address, so don't forget!</p><p><strong>"The Resident Card" is a very important document to prove that you are staying in Japan and must be applied for at the ward office within two weeks of your arrival.</strong> It is also an important document if you wish to apply for a mobile phone number in Japan.</p><p>Why is it not easy to rent an apartment in Japan?</p><ol><li>You usually need to find an agent to rent an apartment in Japan, and because of the language, the choices are limited. But don't forget to look for a few agents. A good agent will look out for you and help you get the right property, rather than asking you to make compromises. In the past, many Chinese bought houses in Japan and rented them out. Some of the properties they rented out were not in good condition and the prices were high, because they knew that the difficulties of foreigners were poor in Japanese and that it was difficult to rent a house, so they were able to rent out even the worst properties. Although the initial conditions for foreigners looking to rent an apartment are inherently poor, there is always a chance of finding a good agent if you have the opportunity to find a few more. After all, the initial cost of renting an apartment in Japan is high and so is the cost of moving, so if you can spend a little more time and effort looking for the right one at the beginning, you will be able to spend less money.</li><li>A guarantor is usually required to rent an apartment in Japan, and it is often preferable for this guarantor to be of Japanese nationality. Most foreigners do not have a guarantor, so when choosing a property to rent, it is usually necessary to consider whether the property is guaranteed by a guarantor company, which of course requires an additional fee.</li><li>It's also harder to find suitable accommodation if you have pets! There are many buildings where pets are not allowed by convention, I guess for fear of "causing disturbance to neighbours". When renting an apartment in Japan, it is very important not to disturb or affect the neighbours, after all it is a communal living environment. In Taiwan, although the management committee keeps an eye on it every day, not everyone is able to do so, but in Japan, although there is no management committee, everyone does their best to maintain the quality of living and not to cause disturbance to others.</li></ol><p>Is the living space in Japan small? It depends on your lifestyle. If you have a lot of clutter, you may have to choose a larger space, but the rents in metropolitan areas are relatively high, so you may have to strike a balance between living space and rent!</p><p>Can you only rent empty houses in Japan? Most of the rental properties in Japan are empty, although some are air-conditioned, but most of them are rented out as empty properties. I guess it is probably because "not to cause distress to others", if the rented property contains furniture or household appliances, but the new tenant wants to buy a new sofa, refrigerator or has these appliances or furniture themselves, then the new tenant has to pay to get rid of these items first.<br>In view of the potential distress caused to the new renter, it is common in Japan to rent accommodation on a vacant basis.Once you have rented an apartment in Japan, you will need to go to the market to buy the appliances and items you need, and of course there are many second-hand furniture sales where you can find the right things. Finally, once you have rented the property, you will need to get the water, electricity and gas connected to the property. If you find a good housing agent, this will be much easier!</p><p><br>As for rent payment, in Japan, it is usually paid by automatic bank deduction, but in order to open a bank account, you need to have a place to live. This was a problem at first, but we could ask our agent to help us coordinate, for example, if we could pay a few months' rent in cash and wait for the bank account to be opened before switching to automatic deduction.</p><blockquote><p>I am grateful when I meet good people or receive help from others when I live abroad!</p></blockquote><p>These are the things that come to mind for the time being for the rental section, but I will leave the rest for another time.<br><br>--To be continued</p></div></div><aside class="post__aside"><div class="post__last-updated u-small">This article was updated on August 5, 2022</div><div class="post__share"></div></aside><footer class="post__footer"><ul class="post__tag box"><li><a href="https://sofiainjp.com/tags/ri-ben-chuang-ye/" class="u-tag u-tag--1" title="Startup in Japan">Startup in Japan</a></li></ul><div class="post__bio box"><div><h4 class="h6"><a href="https://sofiainjp.com/authors/sofia/" title="Sofia">Sofia</a></h4></div></div><nav class="post__nav box"><div class="post__nav__prev"><a href="https://sofiainjp.com/start-up-visa.html" class="post__nav__link" rel="prev"><img src="https://sofiainjp.com/media/posts/24/responsive/3-xs.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="" height="1536" width="1920"><div class="u-small">Previous Post<h5>Startup  in Japan-Start Up Visa</h5></div></a></div><div class="post__nav__next"><a href="https://sofiainjp.com/startup-furniture-and-phone-number.html" class="post__nav__link" rel="next"><div class="u-small">Next Post<h5>Startup in Japan-Furniture &amp; Phone number</h5></div><img src="https://sofiainjp.com/media/posts/26/responsive/5-xs.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="" height="2100" width="3000"></a></div></nav><div class="post__related box"><h3 class="box__title">Related posts</h3><div class="post__related-wrap"><figure class="post__related-item"><a href="https://sofiainjp.com/start-up-visa.html" class="c-card__image"><img src="https://sofiainjp.com/media/posts/24/responsive/3-xs.jpg" loading="lazy" height="1536" width="1920" alt=""></a><figcaption><h4 class="post__related-title"><a href="https://sofiainjp.com/start-up-visa.html" class="inverse">Startup  in Japan-Start Up Visa</a></h4><time datetime="2022-08-05T08:16" class="u-small">August 5, 2022</time></figcaption></figure><figure class="post__related-item"><a href="https://sofiainjp.com/company-establishment.html" class="c-card__image"><img src="https://sofiainjp.com/media/posts/23/responsive/1-xs.jpg" loading="lazy" height="640" width="960" alt=""></a><figcaption><h4 class="post__related-title"><a href="https://sofiainjp.com/company-establishment.html" class="inverse">Startup  in Japan-Company establishment</a></h4><time datetime="2022-08-05T08:15" class="u-small">August 5, 2022</time></figcaption></figure></div></div></footer></article></main><div class="sidebar"><section class="box u-ads"><h3 class="u-ads__title">Advertisement</h3><script async src="https://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js?client=ca-pub-8322803034511439" crossorigin="anonymous"></script></section><section class="box authors"><h3 class="box__title">Authors</h3><ul class="authors__cotainer"><li class="authors__item"><div><a href="https://sofiainjp.com/authors/sofia/" class="authors__title">Sofia</a> <span class="u-small">Post: 26</span></div></li></ul></section><section class="box"><h3 class="box__title">Tags</h3><ul class="tags"><li><a href="https://sofiainjp.com/tags/chugoku-region-zhong-guo-di-fang/">Chugoku Region (中国地方)</a> <span class="u-small">(3)</span></li><li><a href="https://sofiainjp.com/tags/kansai-guan-xi/">Kansai (関西)</a> <span class="u-small">(7)</span></li><li><a href="https://sofiainjp.com/tags/kanto-guan-dong/">Kanto (関東)</a> <span class="u-small">(4)</span></li><li><a href="https://sofiainjp.com/tags/kyushu-jiu-zhou/">Kyushu (九州)</a> <span class="u-small">(2)</span></li><li><a href="https://sofiainjp.com/tags/ri-ben-chuang-ye/">Startup in Japan</a> <span class="u-small">(10)</span></li></ul></section></div><footer class="footer"><a class="footer__logo" href="https://sofiainjp.com/"><img src="https://sofiainjp.com/media/website/Mylogo5-150_150.png" alt="sofiainjp"></a><nav><ul class="footer__nav"></ul></nav><div class="footer__follow"><a href="https://twitter.com/Sofia43927906" aria-label="Twitter"><svg><use xlink:href="https://sofiainjp.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#twitter"/></svg> </a><a href="https://www.instagram.com/sofiainjp/" aria-label="Instagram"><svg><use xlink:href="https://sofiainjp.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#instagram"/></svg> </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGWwtdz7W1PJj_QgSpy6VZA/featured" aria-label="Youtube"><svg><use xlink:href="https://sofiainjp.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#youtube"/></svg></a></div><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Powered by Sofiainjp</p></div></footer></div><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig = {
