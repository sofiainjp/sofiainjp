In addition to discussing your business management plan with the administrative clerk, the administrative clerk will also give you feedback and suggestions to complete your plan, followed by remittance of funds into Japan, but it is not easy to remit funds into Japan!</p><p>In my shallow understanding, your company should first have a Japanese partner and use his name to open a company, bank account, rent an office, as for the details may have to ask the administrative clerk, after all, this is their professional services, find a professional and experienced administrative clerk to discuss, not only in the preparation of documents to give advice, but also to help determine whether the business plan is feasible, a long-term business plan is the prerequisite for everything.</p><blockquote><p>Setting up the company itself is not difficult, but whether or not it can continue to operate smoothly is the real difficulty.</p></blockquote><p>In addition to asking professional administrative clerks to help you apply for a business management visa, there is another type of program called a "business start-up visa". Some local governments have established a support program for foreign entrepreneurs to manage their business activities, and the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) has approved this program, which aims to expand the number of foreign entrepreneurs and promote the development of entrepreneurship.</p><p>When applying for a visa to start a business, foreign entrepreneurs who wish to start a business submit a "Business Preparation Activity Plan", etc. to the local government organization listed below. The local government organization will determine whether the necessary requirements for a visa are met and issue a certificate of confirmation to the foreign entrepreneur. If the foreign entrepreneur submits a certificate of confirmation issued by the local government and the necessary documents to the local immigration office, the foreign entrepreneur will be granted a residence permit for a maximum of one year (to be renewed after six months) for "specified activities" if the result of the examination determines that the requirements are met, and the foreign entrepreneur will be able to prepare for starting a business. After entering Japan and meeting the requirements for the "Management" status of residence during the period of stay, the foreign company may change its status of residence to "Management" and actually start a business in Japan.</p><p>If you have a 6-month "Start-up Visa", you can set up a company after you arrive in Japan. In many places in Japan, there are autonomous organizations that promote foreign entrepreneurial talents, so please refer to the website of the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry's Foreign Entrepreneurial Activities Promotion Program. For example, Tokyo is inclined to entrepreneurial projects such as "urban regeneration, medical treatment, entrepreneurship, employment, promotion of women's activism, etc." and Niigata City also encourages foreigners to start their own businesses there. If you are interested, you can learn more.</p><p>Through the "Start-up Visa", you have the opportunity to start a business in Japan even if you do not have a partner in Japan, that is, by submitting the required information to the local government (in the case of Niigata City)</p><ol><li>Application for Confirmation of Business Startup Activities</li><li>Plan for Business Startup Activities</li><li>Time Schedule of Business Startup Activities</li><li>Resume of the applicant</li><li>Written Pledge</li><li>Documents clarifying where the applicant will be residing for 6 months after arrival in Japan</li><li>Documents detailing the applicant's bank account balance</li><li>A copy of the applicant's passport (the page showing the identification details)</li><li>Other necessary documents</li></ol><p>The local government can provide consultation services in English, we can further understand the information we need to submit through email, so that we can be more perfect preparation, when the information is submitted, the local Japanese personnel will further understand your business through your business plan, the future operation mode, and examine your business model, if there is no problem after examination, the Japanese side will issue a "Certificate of Eligibility", and when this certificate is obtained and means you can enter Japan to formally establish a company.</p><blockquote><p>The most difficult first step is to obtain a "Certificate of Eligibility".</p></blockquote><p>After the first step, the next is to continue to walk
