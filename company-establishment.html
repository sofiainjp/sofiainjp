In 2005, the Japanese government enacted regulations to facilitate foreign businessmen to stay in Japan for a long period of time, the so-called "investment and management visa", and under the Abe regime, further relaxed the restrictions on foreigners starting a business in Japan and renamed the "investment and management visa" to the current "management visa". The "business management visa" is a visa for mid- to long-term stay in Japan that can be applied for by establishing a company in Japan and carrying out business and management activities.</p><p><br>When I was still in Taiwan, I started to search for information on the Internet and learn about the requirements for applying for a business management visa. The following is a summary of the information I found.</p><ol><li>Company size: The new company must invest at least 5 million yen or employ two or more full-time employees. Most people choose to invest at least 5 million yen (the minimum amount) because they have to pay the monthly salary as well as the social benefits (annuity, insurance, etc.) of the employees. The important thing is that the person applying for a business management visa must be doing "business management work".</li><li>Business plan: When applying for a visa, you must submit a business plan to the Immigration Bureau, detailing your company's business content and development direction, and more importantly, you must convince the Japanese government that the business plan is feasible and sustainable, i.e., that you have a long-term business plan and a viable business model.</li><li>Office requirements: a physical office, a shared office or a rented office address or a virtual office is not acceptable.</li><li>Operating right requirement: Applicant must own the actual operating right of the company.</li></ol><p>The "Business Management Visa" expects the applicant to have substantial business management activities and to be able to run a stable business for a long time, bringing tax revenue and employment opportunities to the Japanese society. Many rich people think that if they buy a house in Japan and collect rent as an investment, they can get a business management visa and further immigrate to Japan, but the truth is that if they only buy real estate and collect rent as an investment, then they are not involved in business management and are not eligible for a business management visa.</p><p>All of the above is the information available on the Internet. But what is the actual situation?</p><p>First of all, the company's scale of operation, although it is mentioned in the information that a capital of 5 million yen is fine, but in reality, it is necessary to consider whether you want to come alone or with your family, of course, the higher the capital is the better, after all, it is not as easy as you think to live in Japan, there are many taxes and insurance materials to pay!</p><p>Then there is the business plan, which is a good plan and review of your future business, completed in Chinese and then translated into Japanese with the help of a professional translator. Don't think of it as a mere report. This plan is actually an important basis to help you understand whether your business can survive in Japan.What are all the costs of setting up a business (office rental, internet, utilities, phone, hiring professional staff, cost of products, etc.), and can the income be generated without a deficit? These are all things that a business plan can help you understand. Of course, you can also pay an executive clerk to help you, but you still have to plan it yourself first to get a better idea of the details, right? After all, if you want to be the boss of a company in the future, you can't be unaware of the company's finances and vision!</p><p>How do I rent an office? How do I send money to Japan? This chicken begets the egg begets the chicken question .....<br><br>--Continued</p></div><aside class="post__aside"><div class="post__last-updated u-small">This article was updated on August 5, 2022</div><div class="post__share"></div></aside><footer class="post__footer"><ul class="post__tag box"><li><a href="https://sofiainjp.com/tags/ri-ben-chuang-ye/" class="u-tag u-tag--1" title="Startup in Japan (日本創業)">Startup in Japan (日本創業)</a></li></ul><div class="post__bio box"><div><h4 class="h6"><a href="https://sofiainjp.com/authors/sofia/" title="Sofia">Sofia</a></h4></div></div><nav class="post__nav box"><div class="post__nav__prev"><a href="https://sofiainjp.com/before-start-up.html" class="post__nav__link" rel="prev"><div class="u-small">Previous Post<h5>Before Start up</h5></div></a></div><div class="post__nav__next"><a href="https://sofiainjp.com/start-up-visa.html" class="post__nav__link" rel="next"><div class="u-small">Next Post<h5>Startup-Start Up Visa</h5></div></a></div></nav></footer></article></main><div class="sidebar"><section class="box u-ads"><h3 class="u-ads__title">Advertisement</h3><script async src="https://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js?client=ca-pub-8322803034511439" crossorigin="anonymous"></script></section><section class="box authors"><h3 class="box__title">Authors</h3><ul class="authors__cotainer"><li class="authors__item"><div><a href="https://sofiainjp.com/authors/sofia/" class="authors__title">Sofia</a> <span class="u-small">Post: 26</span></div></li></ul></section><section class="box"><h3 class="box__title">Tags</h3><ul class="tags"><li><a href="https://sofiainjp.com/tags/chugoku-region-zhong-guo-di-fang/">Chugoku Region (中国地方)</a> <span class="u-small">(3)</span></li><li><a href="https://sofiainjp.com/tags/kansai-guan-xi/">Kansai (関西)</a> <span class="u-small">(7)</span></li><li><a href="https://sofiainjp.com/tags/kanto-guan-dong/">Kanto (関東)</a> <span class="u-small">(4)</span></li><li><a href="https://sofiainjp.com/tags/kyushu-jiu-zhou/">Kyushu (九州)</a> <span class="u-small">(2)</span></li><li><a href="https://sofiainjp.com/tags/ri-ben-chuang-ye/">Startup in Japan (日本創業)</a> <span class="u-small">(10)</span></li></ul></section></div><footer class="footer"><a class="footer__logo" href="https://sofiainjp.com/"><img src="https://sofiainjp.com/media/website/Mylogo5-150_150.png" alt="sofiainjp"></a><nav><ul class="footer__nav"></ul></nav><div class="footer__follow"><a href="https://twitter.com/Sofia43927906" aria-label="Twitter"><svg><use xlink:href="https://sofiainjp.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#twitter"/></svg> </a><a href="https://www.instagram.com/sofiainjp/" aria-label="Instagram"><svg><use xlink:href="https://sofiainjp.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#instagram"/></svg> </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGWwtdz7W1PJj_QgSpy6VZA/featured" aria-label="Youtube"><svg><use xlink:href="https://sofiainjp.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#youtube"/></svg></a></div><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Powered by Sofiainjp</p></div></footer></div><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig = {
